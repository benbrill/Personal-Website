description: As a sumbission for Stathlete's Big Data Cup 2021, my partner and I looked at a large set of play-by-play data from the NWHL and 2018 Women's Olympic tournament to determine the most effecitve and most efficient types of passes to generate quality scoring chances.

Whether you’re a casual viewer or a lifelong
hockey analyst, you know that efficient passing is
key to a great offense. Cross crease, outlet, stretch
or just a good ol’ fashioned tape to tape, good
passing leads to goals. While a gorgeous goal might
make the highlight reel, a scoring play or a good look
always starts with crisp, effective passing. For our
question of interest, we wanted to focus on what
types of passes resulted in the high efficiency and
effectiveness. Specifically, which types of passes and
how many of those passes resulted in the best scoring
opportunities. And to measure the effectiveness of
passing, we used expected goals per each shot as
well as an adjusted effectiveness expected goals.

When you’re in the offensive zone, the goal is to
create the best chance possible with the smallest
margin of error. We looked at what passes best
suited a team in achieving that goal We identified
two types of passes -- low-to-high and lateral -- that
we thought would be common during the power play
and would create high danger scoring opportunities.
Taking data from the 2018 Women’s Olympic
Hockey Tournament and the 2019-20 NWHL season,
we looked at offensive zone possessions on the
power play and at even strength to see what the most
common passing patterns during the power play and
to determine which of those passes produces the
best chances and which of those passes produces
the best chances efficiently.
