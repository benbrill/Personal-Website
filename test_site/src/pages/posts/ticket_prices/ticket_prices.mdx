I'm a big Dodgers fan. And sports fan in general. So I like to go to sports games. But going to a bunch of games equals spending a bunch of money. So I often find myself
trying to find the best ways to save money while also getting to go to as many games as I can.

The majority of costs going to a game comes from purchasing tickets (maybe parking eats up a big chunk of spening nowadays as well). So naturally, in order to reduce costs, I need
to find the cheapest tickets. 

Apps like Gametime market themselves as the cheapest way to buy tickets, as long as you are willing to risk waiting until gametime to purchase them. Their logic is that as the
game time approaches, sellers will be more likely to reduce their prices on their tickets in order to ensure that their tickets are sold and that they can net at least some profit.

But, I found that everytime I browsed Gametime, ticket prices rarely had a dramatic decrease from their prices a couple days before. So I was curious whether their logic actually held up;
whether the idea that ticket prices decrease as you get closer to the event time was a myth or the truth.

# Getting the data

While Gametime does not have a readily accessible way of systematically obtaining their ticket prices, I figured that this logic would hold up with any second-hand ticket
broker if it turned out to be true. I went to Stubhub instead, since they have a relativley easy-to-use API. Stubhub also tended to have not only the most stock of tickets out of 
ticket brokers I checked (Gametime, VividSeats, and SeatGeek), but also the cheapest tickets. 

I wrote a `python` script that would scrape ticket data two times a day (5 a.m. and 5 p.m.) for every Los Angels Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, and Los Angeles (Anaheim) Angels home game. 
The scraper would store in an `SQL` Database the time of extraction, the number of days remaining before the game, the lowest ticket price avaliable, the lowest ticket price avaliable including fees,
 and the amount of tickets remaining. 

Overall, I tracked the prices of 153 games across 81 days.

# Difference from Initial prices

One way we can quantify a change in price is a change from the initial listing price. That is, the change from the price of a ticket to a game the first time the scraper was run. 
We can define the "final price" of a ticket as the price of the ticket at the last time the scraper was run before the event occured. All prices used below include fees, since 
that's what we have to pay out of pocket anyway

| Team    | Average Initial Price | Average Final Price | Average Percent Decrease |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Dodgers | $39.03                | $36.90              | 5.78%          |
| Giants  | $48.23                | $36.21              | 16.17%         |
| Angels  | $22.47               | $19.11              | 16.46%         |

We see that ticket prices from all three teams have a lower final price than initial price. However, the Dodger ticket prices tend to be less volatile than the Giants and Angels
prices. In fact, Giants and Angels tickets have a very similar percent decrease. 
Dodger ticket prices also tend to be the highest closest to game time by a slight margin, even though Giants tickets were initially the most expensive. 

The Graph below the average percent difference in price per team for each day leading up to gametime. The more negative the percentage is, the cheaper the prices are at that time 
from the initial listed price.

import SummaryGraph from '../../../components/ticket_graphs/SummaryGraph'

<SummaryGraph metric = "diff_initial"/>

Again, compared to the other teams, the Dodgers line is the most flat, with the least change from the initial listed price overall. However, among all three teams, it appears
that buying tickets with 0 days remaining until game time is not the cheapest option. The biggest dips around gametime appear around the 2 day mark instead of the 0 day mark.

# Plan Ahead or Impromptu Games?

Even if tickets are the cheapest from their initial listed price two days out from gametime, that still might not be enough notice for people to work out all the logistics of 
attending a sporting event. Instead of comparing prices to the very first listed price, let's compare them to the prices of tickets a week out from gametime. 

import SevenGraph from '../../../components/ticket_graphs/SevenGraph'

Across the board, there isn't much of a difference between purchasing your tickets seven days out or purchasing them sooner. This could mean that ticket prices have already
reached their floor or that sellers really don't adjust prices a week before the game.

Dodgers ticket are slightly cheaper (-8%) the day of the game than they were a week before the game where Angels tickets are the exact opposite (8%). Giants tickets are 1% more
expensive the day of the game than they were a week before the game.
